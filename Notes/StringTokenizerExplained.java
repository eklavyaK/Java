import java.lang.String;

// The java.util.StringTokenizer class allows you to break a String into tokens. It is simple way to break a String.



/* Different constructors in StringTokenizer class

1. StringTokenizer(String str): default delimiters like newline, space, tab, carriage return, and form feed are used too separate the tokens

2. StringTokenizer(String str, String delim):  delim is a set of delimiters that are used to tokenize the given string.

3. StringTokenizer(String str, String delim, boolean flag): The first two parameters have the same meaning wherein The flag 
serves the following purpose.

(i) If the flag is false, delimiter characters serve to separate tokens

Example:

Input : if string --> "hello geeks" and Delimiter is " ", then 
Output:  tokens are "hello" and "geeks".

(ii) If the flag is true, delimiter characters are considered to be tokens.

Example:

Input : String --> is "hello geeks"and Delimiter is " ", then 
Output: Tokens --> "hello", " " and "geeks".

			Method	                    Action Performed

			hasMoreTokenss()	        Tests if tokens are present for the StringTokenizerâ€™s string without shifting the cursor
			nextElement()	            Returns an Object rather than String, and shifts the cursor to next token
			hasMoreElements()	        Returns the same value as hasMoreTokens doesn't shift the cursor
			nextToken()	                Returns the next token from the given StringTokenizer, and shifts the cursor to next token
